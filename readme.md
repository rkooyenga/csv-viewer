# CSV Reader App

Nice easy reading layout for CSV string data with a rolling highlight for focused row. Lots of input options, if you just want to quickly read some data, this can open a local file.

Or, as its default demo, any of a million `.csv` files on Github in remote URL mode.

Or, try passing to `?url=` on load!

Or (yes, there's somehow more) you can raw dog it and just paste that data in or type it out. You're probably wondering what the catch is, it's so great. I hear you, it's so awesome I'm getting suspicious too. It gets crazier though...

Since you can paste or type data raw in the box on the side panel and even render that well, I thought how much would it suck if you swiped wrong, your phone refreshed, and you lost that. So now, if you submit data that way, it persists in your browser's `localStorage` database. Just open the side panel again, and it should be there if you weren't in incognito mode.

**That's it, thought right? Right?**

Don't hate me, but... there's more. I made it a PWA so you can install it as an app.

**And**

**Note:** Project is based on a Chromebook releases page circa 2012. What an exciting time: HTML5, CSS3, WebGL, Chrome Extensions, ChromeOS. I loved the Chromium team's simple but so readable coloring scheme on that particular page. While I was gonna make a more studly modern b&w, what if I bring that Chromium team thing back? As a nod to them and those exciting early days of ChromeOS, HTML5, CSS3, etc.

I think it's legit useful too. Just need to finish styling the panel.
